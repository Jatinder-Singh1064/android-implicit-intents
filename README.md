ANDROID - IMPLICIT INTENTS
Requirements: Design and build an app to demo the use of different types of implicit intents, including the following in a single activity:

1. Add Calendar Event: Create proper UI and logic to add calendar event with the following fields (to get event details from user):
    • Event title
    • Start time
    • End time
    • CheckBox for “All Day Event” (if checked, start time and end time will be neglected)
    • Event description
    • Emails of invitees (may be a single line of comma separated emails)
    • Switch view for access type (private or public access)
    Then add the calendar event to the phone calendar app using an implicit intent when “ADD EVENT” button is clicked.
    
2. Capture a photo and show it in the app: Pressing a “Capture” button will start an intent that opens the camera to take a photo and store 
    it in a predefined location. The result of the intent(the photo) will be displayed in an ImageView.
    
3. Phone Call Event: When clicked on button, an Intent activity should open and ask for the phone number to enter in the TextView. After entering the phone number,
     user will click on button 'Call' and it wil take you to the phone's default calling app with the phone number displayed on the screen. When call is made,
     it should call the number and make a call.
